# Black-Jack_Card-Game
Hey! This is my third project in python and was a very fun project to code, I hope you guys like, however keep in mind that in the game the dealer does not have the option to choose the value for the ACE card, I could have made it but I didnt, I dont know why I just didnt feel like adding it... Anyway its a simple game with simple rule, for now it's only one player game, I might add the option for multi-player in the future. Thank You.
